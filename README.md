# Flying robot

[A flying robot has been built as a development platform.](https://github.com/PhilippeDoucette/Intel-RTF-Drone-with-servo-control/wiki)  Client/Server architecture is used to reduce the computational load on the robot.  Most processing is done on servers, while robots act as clients.  A robot may then have a smaller computer and lower cost. The servers share workload among many robot-clients. Computation that would be difficult or impossible to perform on the robot is done on the servers.  
### Server-side Processing
  * Large dataset queries
  * Human voice processing
  * Image recognition
  * Swarm coordination
  * Long-range path Planning
  
### Client-side Processing
  * Stablility and movement
  * Sensor polling
  * Servo control
  * Speech and sound output
  * Short-range path planning

## Example Application
Searching for a lost person, as an application example would require image processing, long-range navigation, voice processing, and other computationally intensive tasks that are best run on a server.  The robot would be connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or a cellular data network.  Servers would be data center located. High level human control would be done via workstation or mobile device.

## Hardware

IntelÂ® RTF Drone connected to an Arduino provides a powerful ROS computer with simple connections to external devices. All manner of servos, stepper motors, and a vast array of sensors may be connected to a flying/driving robot platform. The Intel system runs ROS Ubuntu and connects to the Arduino using RosSerial.
