# Flying robot

[A flying robot has been built as a development platform.](https://github.com/PhilippeDoucette/Intel-RTF-Drone-with-servo-control/wiki)  Most of the robotic computation is done on servers, while the robot acts as a client.

IntelÂ® RTF Drone connected to an Arduino provides a powerful ROS computer with simple connections to external devices. All manner of servos, stepper motors, and a vast array of sensors may be connected to a flying/driving robot platform. The Intel system runs ROS Ubuntu and connects to the Arduino using RosSerial.
