# Flying robot

[A flying robot has been built as a development platform.](https://github.com/PhilippeDoucette/Intel-RTF-Drone-with-servo-control/wiki)  Servers are networked with the robot to provide related processing. Multiple robots may participate in this Client/Server architecture, used to reduce the computational load on the robots.  Most processing is done on servers, while robots act as clients.  The robots may then have smaller computers and lower cost. The servers share workload among many robot-clients. Computation that would be difficult or impossible to perform on the robot is done on the servers.  
| Server-side              | Client-side               |
| ------------------------ |---------------------------|
| Large dataset queries    | Stablility and movement   |
| Human voice processing   | Speech and sound output   |
| Image recognition        | Sensor polling            |
| Swarm coordination       | Servo control             |
| Long-range path Planning | Short-range path planning |


## Example Application
Searching for a lost person would require image processing, long-range navigation, voice processing, and other computationally intensive tasks that are best run on a server.  The robot would be connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or a cellular data network.  Servers would be data center located. High level human control would be done via workstation or mobile device.

## Hardware

IntelÂ® RTF Drone connected to an Arduino provides a powerful ROS computer with simple connections to external devices. All manner of servos, stepper motors, and a vast array of sensors may be connected to a flying/driving robot platform. The Intel system runs ROS Ubuntu and connects to the Arduino using RosSerial.
