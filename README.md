# Servos and stepper motors controlled by the Intel® RTF Drone.

In this project, an Arduino will be connected to an Intel® RTF Drone using the USB port, or through the UART via the Telemetry port. Thus, all manner of things can then be controlled by the drone's code, such as servos, stepper motors, and a vast array of sensors.  

The [goal is to create a flying robot](https://github.com/PhilippeDoucette/Intel-RTF-Drone-with-servo-control/wiki)
