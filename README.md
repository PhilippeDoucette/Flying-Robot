# Flying robot

[A flying robot has been built as a development platform.](https://github.com/PhilippeDoucette/Intel-RTF-Drone-with-servo-control/wiki)  Client/Server architecture is used to reduce the computational load on the robot.  Most computation is done on servers, while the robot acts as a client.  The robot may then have a smaller computer and lower cost. The server shares its workload among many robot-clients.  
Computation that would be difficult or impossible to perform on the robot is done on the servers.  
* Large datasets
* Human voice processing 
* Swarm oordination

## Hardware

IntelÂ® RTF Drone connected to an Arduino provides a powerful ROS computer with simple connections to external devices. All manner of servos, stepper motors, and a vast array of sensors may be connected to a flying/driving robot platform. The Intel system runs ROS Ubuntu and connects to the Arduino using RosSerial.
