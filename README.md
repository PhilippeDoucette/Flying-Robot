# Flying robot

IntelÂ® RTF Drone connected to a Arduino provides a powerful ROS computer with simple connections to external devices. All manner of servos, stepper motors, and a vast array of sensors may be connected to a flying/driving robot platform. The Intel system runs ROS Ubuntu and connects to the Arduino using RosSerial.
