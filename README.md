# Servos and stepper motors controlled by the Intel® RTF Drone.

In this project, an Arduino will be connected to an Intel® RTF Drone using the USB port, or through the UART via the Telemetry port. Thus, all manner of things can then be controlled by the drone's code, such as servos, stepper motors, and a vast array of sensors.  

There are three physical methods for connecting Arduino:
1. Arduino USB to the RTF Drone USB
2. Arduino serial port to Telemetry port using a Bi-Directional Logic Level Converter
3. Arduino Due board to Telemetry port

ROS (Robot Operating System) is installed on the Intel® RTF Drone
